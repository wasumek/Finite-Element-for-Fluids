# Finite Element Method for Fluid Dynamics Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of a course on the Finite Element Method (FEM) for fluid dynamics. The projects focus on the application of FEM to solve steady and unsteady fluid flow problems, using numerical techniques to simulate fluid behavior governed by Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations.

## Overview

Fluid dynamics is a critical field of study in both engineering and physics, dealing with the movement of fluids and their interactions with boundaries. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful numerical technique used to solve the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) of fluid mechanics, particularly the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the flow behavior of incompressible fluids. This repository features MATLAB-based implementations to tackle steady and unsteady fluid flow problems using FEM.

## Projects

1. **Steady Stokes and Navier-Stokes Problems**: This project implements the FEM to solve steady-state fluid flow governed by the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, providing insights into the velocity field and pressure distribution for incompressible fluids.

2. **Unsteady Transport Problems**: This project focuses on solving time-dependent fluid transport problems using FEM, where the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations describe the fluid's evolution over time.

## Installation

To run the code, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasumek/Finite-Element-for-Fluids.git
```

## Usage

The MATLAB scripts provided implement finite element solutions for the described fluid dynamics problems. To run the simulations, load the corresponding scripts in MATLAB and execute them. Each script contains detailed comments to guide users through the configuration and output interpretation. Users can modify parameters such as boundary conditions, flow properties, and time steps to explore different fluid dynamics scenarios. The projects also include visualization tools for examining the pressure and velocity fields in steady and unsteady flows.
